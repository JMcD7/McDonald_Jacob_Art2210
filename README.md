For my first Creative Coding assignment I feel like I struggled more than I would like to admit. I wanted to recreate myself but the more I messed around in the software the the more I started going for the abstract look. I was unsure how I was going to make anything actually look like me. I had a lot of different forms of inspiration but eventually pivoted to the Japanese Manga style many people are familiar with. I ended up creating my version of one of these characters that doesn’t exactly look like me but it is a representation of the stress and emotions that I put into this project. Simplicity is not always good but in this case these artists are able to use simple lines and little detail to display large amounts of emotion in their character sketches. If anyone has seen an Anime cartoon or comic they know what I am talking about. The best way these artists show emotion is through the massive eyes or facial expressions. I was at no level to recreate these eyes inside a coding program so i opted to show more emotion than anything. My biggest inspiration came to me from my youth when I used to watch Naruto; the Japanese artist Masashi Kishimoto is a perfect example of how these artists display so much emotion and tell so much through so little use of detail. Another Manga artist I am really into is Hajime Isayama. His designs seem slightly more developed in the final stage but still show insane amounts of emotion with very simple line work and shading. At this point I was inspired and began to crank out this design. In the end I am very happy with my work being the first time I’ve seriously messed around with code. I wish I would have been able to use some variables to make the sweat on my characters face drip down but I wasn’t able to get that code to run properly. I also wanted to experiment more with curved lines but that was also giving me too much trouble. So here it is. - Jacob
